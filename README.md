# Bikesharing Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether there is a good investment opportunity to create a bikesharing business opportunity in Des Moines Iowa.  We are going to use some data from NYC bikesharing to perform an initial analysis that could provide some additional insights and determine whether additional investigation is warranted or whether we should abandon this idea.  
# Results
A.  **Checkout Times for Users:**
Overall bikes are not checked out for long periods of time.  They are generally checked out for less than 30 minutes, so it appears that users are checking out bikes for shorter trips, to get from point a to poitn b instead of taking bikes on trail rides or family outings.  The bikes appear to serve a distinct purpose.

**B.  Checkout Times by Gender:**
The checkout times by gender follow the same trends as the overall checkout times by user, however the data shows that there are many more males in general checking out bikes.

**C. Trips by Weekday for Each Hour:**
There are a higher number of rides concentrated around 7-10am and 4-8pm, which is around the time that users could be commuting to and from work.  Overall, there are less rides on the wekeends.  There could be an opportunity to promote and offer discounts to increase ridership on the weekends.

**D. User Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour):** 
	There are less number of rides by women compared to males, which could be due to some factors, including having to worry about their hair getting messed up with helmets and trying to go to work and fix their hair.

**E. User Trips by Gender by Customer Type:**
Overall, we have a much higher number of rides for male subscribers and for those male subscribers, it looks like they are also using the bikes more on the weekends.  We should try and increase subscriberships as well as find opportunities to promote femail subscriptions to increase female riders.

**F.  Ride Counts:  
Overall there are over 2M rides in August in NYC.  We need to perform additional analysis on the other months to see if there is variability in seasonality of ridership.  In addition, NYC is much larger than Des Moines, so we need to better understand what a reasonble number of rides could be expected in a smaller metropolitan area.

**G. Peak hours of August Rides**
This graph supports the other graph showing that the peak hours of rides are during commute hours.  There could be an opportunity to offer discounts to inrease ridership during non-peak hours.

# Summary
Overall, there is a potential opportunity to investigate bikesharing in Des Moines Iowa.  However, basing a decision only on NYC data is not a wise decision as there are many potential differences between the urban areas that need to be considered.  SOme items for consideration are included below:
1.  We need to better understand the demographics of Des Moines area residents as it looks like many riders in NYC are using bikes to commute to and from work.  Are their similar demographics in Des Moines Iowa?  Do workers live close enough to work to be able to ride bikes or are they commuting from further out?  Also, is the bike system/road system bike rider friendly?
2.  We need to further investigate other months of the year to understand in what months is it feasible that riders would be able to use the bikes and what the potential impact to our revenue and costs this would have.
3.  I would also recommend some additional analysis to understand how we may be able to promote ridership among the female or family group of individuals as this may be a group that we could target, in addition to those bikers using the bikes for commuting.  There may be an opportunity to increase ridership as well as the length of ride checkout.  
4.  We should consider investigating a city more comparable in size to Des Moines, such as the Minneapolis St. Paul area.
